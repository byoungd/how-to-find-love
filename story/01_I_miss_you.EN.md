# I MISS YOU

- I say you look so different with or without glasses
- You laugh and say you're used to hiding behind them

- You always give me a big smile
- When I look at you
- That smile, that look
- Reminds me of someone
- That lovely girl

- Ten years ago
- She sat across from me
- We ate hot pot together
- Laughing and talking
- You looked at me
- I looked at you
- Time flew by

- I often visited that hot pot place alone later

- You liked to listen to me ramble on
- But you never said a word
- You said you were always a listener
- And envied how I could express myself freely
- But you didn't know
- I wanted to be a listener too
- And hear your inner thoughts

- After dinner
- I said even though we lived next door
- I never saw you in the morning
- You said you left early, around 8:20
- You used the word early well
- I laughed, I left at 7:30 sharp

- We walked back one after another
- Chatting casually
- I could feel the subtle awkwardness
- The next morning I deliberately left after 8
- The narrow road was crowded with people
- Everyone wore masks because of the pandemic
- A girl's height and hair looked like yours
- But it wasn't you

- Your outfit today
- A black wool sweater with a white short sleeve
- A bright flower on the collar of your coat
- I liked it a lot

- I asked why I didn't see you this morning
- You said you got up at 7 today
- I stared at your sweet smile
- And said nothing

- Would this be the last time we see each other?

- Next time, would I have the courage to tell you
- Tell you
- I like you
- With or without glasses.
