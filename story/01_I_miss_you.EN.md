# I MISS YOU

- You look so different with or without glasses, I say
- You laugh and say you're used to hiding behind them
- You always give me a big smile when I look at you
- That smile, that look, reminds me of someone
- That lovely girl, ten years ago
- She sat across from me, we ate hot pot together
- Laughing and talking, you looked at me, I looked at you
- Time flew by, I often visited that hot pot place alone later
- You liked to listen to me ramble on, but you never said a word
- You said you were always a listener and envied how I could express myself freely
- But you didn't know, I wanted to be a listener too and hear your inner thoughts
- After dinner, I said even though we lived next door, I never saw you in the morning
- You said you left early, around 8:20, you used the word early well
- I laughed, I left at 7:30 sharp
- We walked back one after another, chatting casually
- I could feel the subtle awkwardness
- The next morning I deliberately left after 8
- The narrow road was crowded with people
- Everyone wore masks because of the pandemic
- A girl's height and hair looked like yours, but it wasn't you
- Your outfit today, a black wool sweater with a white short sleeve
- A bright flower on the collar of your coat, I liked it a lot
- I asked why I didn't see you this morning, you said you got up at 7 today
- I stared at your sweet smile and said nothing
- Would this be the last time we see each other?
- Next time, would I have the courage to tell you?
- Tell you, I like you, with or without glasses.
